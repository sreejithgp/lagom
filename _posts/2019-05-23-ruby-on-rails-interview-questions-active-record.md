* ### ***Object Relational Mapping?***

  ORM is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type
  systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates a virtual
  object database and can be used in OOP language.

  Simply in ActiveRecord terms, classes are mapped to table in the database, and
  objects are mapped to the rows of the table.
